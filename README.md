# DuckDuckGo Safari Extension

## What
Very rudimentary Safari extension which installs a DuckDuckGo search bar onto Safari 5+.


## Background
I love DuckDuckGo and it always annoyed me that the plugin Glims had to be installed to add DuckDuckGo to the search bar. Unfortunately, Safari Extensions cannot alter the search bar (At least I don't think! Prove me wrong!) so this adds a new toolbar with a DuckDuckGo search in it. This extension also adds a context menu search.


## Download
The extension can be downloaded at:  http://vaporstun.com/files/duckduckgo-safari-extension/DuckDuckGoBar.safariextz


## Enabling Extensions
* You must have Safari 5 installed:  http://www.apple.com/safari/download/
* Go into Preferences... | Advanced | Check "Show Develop menu in menu bar" | Close Preferences
* In menu bar, go to Develop | Enable Extensions


## Issues/Support
This is a pet project, and as such, there is absolutely no warranty at all. Use at your own risk. This is also being actively developed, so expect it to change frequently. If there are issues, feel free to log them here:  http://github.com/vaporstun/duckduckgo-safari-extension/issues


## Other Notes
You will need to sign up for a Safari Extension Certificate if you want to fork and build the extension. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, click here: http://lmddgtfy.com/?q=safari%20extension%20certificate
