# DuckDuckGo Safari Extension

## What is it?
Very rudimentary Safari extension which provides a DuckDuckGo search bar in Safari 5+.


## Background
I love DuckDuckGo. But it always annoyed me that the plugin Glims had to be installed to add DuckDuckGo to the search bar. Unfortunately, Safari Extensions cannot alter the search bar. (At least, I don’t think so.  I’d love it if you proved me wrong!)

So, this extension adds a new toolbar with a DuckDuckGo search in it. It also adds a context menu search.


## Download
The extension can be downloaded at:  http://vaporstun.com/files/duckduckgo-safari-extension/DuckDuckGoBar.safariextz


## Enabling Extensions
* You must have [Safari 5+](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/) installed
* Open **Safari ▶ Preferences...** (shortcut: `⌘,`)
 * Select **Advanced**
 * Check the box **Show Develop menu in menu bar**
 * Close Preferences
* In menu bar, select **Develop ▶ Enable Extensions**


## Issues/Support
This is a pet project, and as such, there is absolutely no warranty at all. Use at your own risk. The project is also under active development, so expect it to change frequently.

If there are issues, [feel free to report them.](http://github.com/vaporstun/duckduckgo-safari-extension/issues)


## Other Notes
You will need to sign up for a Safari Extension Certificate if you want to fork and build the extension.
